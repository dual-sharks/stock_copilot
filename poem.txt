In morning's light, the eggs do softly break,  
With gentle hands, the yolks and whites do blend,  
A dance of flavors, savory to partake,  
In skillet's warmth, their journey doth ascend.  

With herbs and cheese, a symphony of taste,  
The omelette forms, a golden, tender crest,  
A breakfast feast, with nary a moment waste,  
In every bite, the morn's delight is dressed.  

So let us raise our forks to this fine art,  
An omelette made with love, a perfect start.
